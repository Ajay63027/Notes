what is devOps ?
before devOps used methods
1.waterfall methods---> just like waterfall (complete ga devlopment ayyaka next step testing  ki velledhi its waste lot of time and resources and still not get satistied results)
 once requirements are fixed we can't change
 2 years project to go for PROD

 last 1 year
 last 1 month deploy --> 100 defects
 20 invalid defects --> 

 process change --> Agile

item --> 1 test --> 2 defects
1000 test --> 3 defects
2.agile methods -----> dintlo oka set of devlopment ayyaka testing ki move chese vallu better than waterfall but still not satistied
  Final product --> multiple modules --> sprint
  item --> 1 test --> 2 defects
  1000 test --> 3 defects
  
 Final product --> multiple modules --> sprints

  login and signup --> sprint-1 --> 30 days
  orders

  reviews
  employees

  sprint-1
  ----------
 clients UAT(user acceptance testing)

  daily standups --> 

  95% --> 5 defects, 1 invalid defect

  sprint-2 --> orders + 4 defects

  15 days 15 days testing and deployment

Process change --> Agile with DevOps

DAY-1 --> enter first name, enter last name, enter DOB

deploy on the same day, test on the same day
10 defects --> 1 invalid defect

DevOps is the process of building, deploying and testing the code written by developer on the same day instead of doing after complete development.. we can acheive this using continous integration, continous deployment, continous delivery and continous testing. 
We can do faster releases with less defect using DevOps... basically automation mindset to get the best results
